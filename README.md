## What this is about

This contains the website hosted on rahoff.enforge.de. It's more of a private project, but as it's a working example of my hugo-fomantic-template, maybe it will be usefull for others as well.

## How to get started

- `npm create vite@latest`
  framework: svelte
  template: demo
  type: sveltekit
  additional packages: eslint, prettier
- `cp <projectname>/* ./ && rm -d <projectname>`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` || `npm run build`
