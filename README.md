# rahoff.enforge.de

## What this is about
This contains the website hosted on rahoff.enforge.de. It's more of a private project, but as it's a working example of my hugo-fomantic-template, maybe it will be usefull for others as well.

## How to get started

- `npm init svelte <projectname>`
  template: skeleton
  types: checkjs
  eslint: true
  prettier: true
  playwright: false
- `cp <projectname>/* ./ && rm -d <projectname>`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` || `npm run build`
---
- `npm create vite@latest <projectname> --template svelte`
- `cp <projectname>/* ./ && rm -d <projectname>`
- `npm install`
- `npx vite` -> for development | `npx vite build` -> for prod build
