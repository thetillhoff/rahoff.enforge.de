# template_hugo_fomantic

## what this is about

In December 2019 I wanted to create a simple static website. I had previous experience with Semantic-UI the predecessor of Fomantic-UI, so this was a go-to.
As the plain CSS file was a pain to customize on my last project with it, I wanted to start right away with it's SASS version.
I also looked at several static site generators (and other frameworks like react), but most were either too complex and an overkill or not flexible enough as I didn't want to just use a blogging-framework.
Or the learning curve was quite steep.
Hugo was both flexible and simple enough. Also, it is written in Go instead of Ruby (looking at you Jekyll) which was also a criteria.

Yet, I had neither a workflow for developing a website with Hugo, nor have I found a Hugo tutorial/example with Fomantic-UI integrated.

So what I want to do here:

### TL;DR
You can use this to create a template for creating new static websites using Hugo and Fomantic-UI.
The actual content/website is in the folder ```./website/```.
